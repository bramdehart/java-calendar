Note: For an out-of-the box functionality, appointments could better be stored in for example a JSON-file. This is a school project, for which the use of a database was required. 

## Installation
A database import is required before using the application. See attached sql-file.

## Description
Java Calendar made with the Swing GUI toolkit.
 
## Navigation
Navigation between different monthpanels can be done in two ways:
* Entering a date in the toppanel
* Using the navigation buttons (previous / current / next month)

The fields "Name", "Start time" and "End time" are required. The others are optional.
